### Notes
Some challenges I encountered while making this application was retrieving the links to the images from the API Request and displaying them on the app. I was able to resolve this using CocoaPods to download the movie poster images.  In addition, I had issues with the spacing and design aspect on different iphone models therefor I used the iphone 11 as the base model for this application.
